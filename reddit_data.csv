"I lost $1,030,220.81 in the stock market.","I've held this in long enough. The shame, guilt, lies. Pretending to be cool and knowing what the fuck I'm talking about. I've been holding this in for years. I've cried and cried and cried. I'm fed up with my bitch behavior. It's time to fucking take things into my own hands and change. I'm not stopping, I'm going to gain this all back the slow, and right way. Here's my story.

In 2019 I learned about the stock market. Like a responsible retail investor, I created baskets and diversified my equity investments.

In 2020, I learned about options.

My first gamble was a meme stock I found on WSB that rhymes with Ped Pad Peyon. That was the start of my entire $1M loss and life downfall.

It felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.

But it also felt like the end of the world when it all went to $0.

For some reason, I always came back. I tasted the forbidden fruit, and was addicted.

Fast forward two years, I needed a source for more trading capital - I sold my house and car, maxed out credit cards, borrowed from the bank, and lenders. I lied to family/friends to get money, and worked odd jobs that were shameful.

My wife who I'd been with for 12 years left me, we didn't sign a prenup so there was that whole process...then she took custody of the kids.

Sure, I lost $1,030,220.81. But the worst part of it all, is I lost loved ones, every friend in my life, and every single asset I owned. I cried like a fucking bitch for days on end, slept on benches, backyards, and under bridges.

I managed to save up some money, and am now living on my own, in a one-bedroom apartment.

I know it I can do this. I know I can make it all back. I've heard stories and seen people do it. I understand all the technical analysis, indicators, price action, gamma exposure, OI, risk-free interest, blah blah fucking blah. I know it all. What made me lose it all wasn't my understanding of the markets, it was my ego, my greed, and lack of discipline. My psyche.

I've spent the last 2 yrs dedicating myself to mastering every technical aspect of the market. I've met 10 figure retail investors, hedgefund managers, and everyone in between. Really dedicated myself to learning the markets. Most importantly, I've made good progress mastering my emotions. I've even gone on months without masturbating. I needed to model a stimulus that was just as rewarding as gambling.

I'm here to show that I can gradually get out of this hell-hole.

I've managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I'm just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn't over.

Is it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me. But I've tamed it. I guess if you're looking for entertainment, or a person to root for, you can find me on X. Username is lost1million. I'll try to give periodic updates here as well.

This is pretty much it for me. Here we go.

P.S. Please don't report me to the suicide prevention. While I appreciate the sympathy, the messages I get are quite annoying. I will be fine. I am fine.

I bought $700k worth of Intel stock today ,"https://preview.redd.it/83gh52szi2gd1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba99bb67e4b11aa973fe830f535c775083bbc05

TLDR: Grandma died 2 months ago. Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. 

Here's why I like Intel: 

- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY 

- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. 

- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. 

- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. 

- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD 

- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. 

- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024

- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. 

- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 

- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry 

- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)

"Trump Media stock tanks as new filing reveals heavy losses, 'greater risks' on Trump's involvement","Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, sank more than 22% in midday trading on Monday following its blockbuster debut last week.

The stock drop comes on the heels of an updated regulatory filing early Monday that showed the company taking on heavy losses and facing ""greater risks"" associated with the former president's ties to the platform.

According to the filing, Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.

Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom. ",1719402652.0,4132,1328,2024-06-26 11:50:52

Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.,"Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.","You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\*\*

\*\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\*\*

\*\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\*\*\*

"All is not well with this economy, yet stocks keep going up.","This euphoria is strangely reminiscent of something past, though I am not sure what exactly.

(1) Retails sales yoy are not growing.

(2) Industrial production yoy is not growing.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Bp2G

Together, these two form the bulk of the economy. If their yoy growth is not positive, we get grey bars.

(3) Bank balance sheets have plateaued recently (see the top right corner of the chart). This means either banks have stopped lending or people are defaulting on their loans or both.

"South Korean stocks down 6% today on South Korea declaring martial law, buy the dip","The news sounds scary, but it's just the president declaring martial law because he's upset that his opposition won, and because they are launching a corruption investigation into him/his wife, so he's trying to paint them as North Korea supporters. There's no actual emergency, North Korea hasn't done anything, it's just lame duck president stirring up trouble.

South Korean markets were already insanely cheap before this dip, trading at 11-12x earnings, compared to 31x earnings for the US markets.

Positions: Buying EWY today

edit: I bought EWY at $53-54. It's at $55.50 now, I wouldn't buy above $55 unless the situation is resolved and fx rates recover, because IMO korean stocks will dip when their market opens.

edit 2: Korean Parliament voted to overturn the martial law declaration, also their Finance Minister stated that unlimited liquidity injections and other measures will be enacted if necessary to maintain stability. I'm holding for now, but refraining from buying more unless it dips below $54 again.

edit 3: Military is saying martial law still in effect until the president cancels it. I'm being cautious, sold some at $55.30 but still holding most, not buying any more at this price bc at this point most of the remaining drop can be attributed to fx rates, I think Koreans will dump stocks when their market opens in the morning.

Edit 4: president says he'll end martial law. That was fun. ez gains. At this point the drop in price is roughly equal to the Korean won's depreciation, suggesting that the market is pricing the korean market opening flat. I'm still bullish long term on Korea but I can definitely see a dip after hours when the Korean market opens.",1733238936.0,1996,383,2024-12-03 15:15:36

The Stock Market Has Generated No Real Returns Over the Last 50 Years.,"If you traded a bar of gold in 1972 for a share in the S&P 500, over 50 years later your share would be worth that same bar of gold.

https://preview.redd.it/063s8uhzrmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=275d71f796a94ef498d1090bdc32cfee474f44d3

Since we went off the gold standard, the stock market has not increased in real value. It has only preserved wealth. This can be further illustrated by dividing the S&P 500 by the M2 Money Supply.

https://preview.redd.it/q56zbzv0smbc1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f52f44ab422f53ce554e52a9b9c79ac6216a6c

But we have had gains in productivity over the last 50 years - Computers, The Internet, Automation, Globalization, Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì where have all the gains in productivity gone? To the middle class? Obviously not, but let‚Äôs illustrate it anyways.

https://preview.redd.it/z09ys082smbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0648836530a4cfd85be03ef6039010b5b532edaf

Which leaves one final culprit. The government.

The government has effectively taxed all productivity gains in society at an average rate of 100% over the last 50 years - since we went off the gold standard.

If enough people care, I'll post a part 2 explaining how I think they've done this.

*Edit: I had no idea so many people invested in the S&P just for the 1.5% dividend, nor that they were able to perfectly reinvest their dividends without incurring any commissions, management fees, or taxes, for the last 50 years. You‚Äôll all have to tell me your secrets.*

MY (f19) BF (22M) JERKED OFF TO THE STOCK MARKET??," 

I know the title sounds deranged, but I swear to god im not a troll. Here‚Äôs the context:

My bf and I are long distance, so we used to have plenty of phone sex, however, that‚Äôs been happening less and less often as our relationship has gone on (according to him, he just doesn‚Äôt feel as horny as often anymore). We‚Äôve met and had relations irl a few times, and he‚Äôs always the kind to last very long in bed, and during phone sex as well. I used to be insecure about it, thinking that maybe it was something wrong with me, but hes genuinely a great bf who constantly assures me, and has never once said anything bad about our sex life.

It should be noted that he watches plenty of porn (as do I), and neither of us see that as an issue, so this isnt about him hiding porn from me or something. We were calling today, and I was playing a game on my phone (papa‚Äôs cupcakeria, you can‚Äôt make this shit up), and after about twenty minutes of us doing our own thing, he suddenly goes ‚Äúim done‚Äù and shows me his cum????? Obviously, I get really confused and ask how the hell he was jerking off this whole time without me realising (we were on video call), before mentioning that I thought he was looking at the stock market (he spends his free time just staring at the stock market for hours on end like a lunatic, but I love him so it‚Äôs whatever).

Tell me why this man then looks me in the eyes and goes ‚Äúyeah, I was looking at the stock market, I was too lazy to look for porn.‚Äù

It then hits me that he literally just CAME to the stock market. When I point this out to him, all he said in response was ‚Äúit‚Äôs a man thing, I didn‚Äôt wanna bother you while you were playing your game‚Äù and told me not to worry about it.

Now, I don‚Äôt want to sound insane, but I got a bit upset, because in my head, he could have very easily asked to have phone sex with me, but chose to literally jerk off to the stock market instead. To add insult to injury, he came REALLY quickly (like significantly quicker than he would during anything involving me) which makes me feel like SHIT, because there is no way the goddamn stock market is somehow more stimulating than his own damn girlfriend.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm not super genuinely upset, but you‚Äôve gotta admit this shits gonna hurt your pride if it happened to you. I honest to god have no idea how to even move forward after this, and I just needed to type this out, because no one would believe me otherwise üíÄ",1691474267.0,5871,1039,2023-08-08 05:57:47
"Lost at sea. My stock market nightmare.

I'm a sailor, busting my ass on a ship and trying to build my financial future by investing in the stock market. It's my little hobby while out at sea.

My plan is to withdraw cash like 100$ from them and deposit it with a different bank then transfer it back to them and withdraw the same 100 $ until they run out of physical cash.

"NYSE to ‚Äúbust‚Äù all the ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share","""Investors who purchased shares in Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway yesterday at a huge discount will see their trades canceled following a technical issue on the stock exchange.

On June 3, a data glitch led the global conglomerate‚Äôs stock price to fall to $185 a share, having previously closed at over $620,000. The drop meant a more than 99% discount on the Warren Buffett-led company.

This means a trader who snapped up just $925 worth of the stock at the rock-bottom price would now see their investment worth over $3 million today.

While it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed how many people purchased the Class A stock during the technical error‚Äîwhich lasted for around an hour and a half‚Äîthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has swiftly undone their trades.

In an update posted at 9 p.m. last night, NYSE said it would ‚Äúbust‚Äù all the ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share.

The issue, the exchange added, is related to a problem at the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA), which provides real-time information about quotes and trades on the exchange. The CTA oversees part of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) which consolidates all protected bid/ask quotes and trades into a single data stream.

The CTA said it experienced problems with price banding which ‚Äúmay have been related to a new software release‚Äù on SIP. As a result the CTA has reverted to the previous version of the software. The CTA did not immediately respond to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment.

During the blip, the NYSE placed halts on certain trades, and will seek to determine which are erroneous and thus eligible to be canceled. The technical issue has now been resolved, it added, with all tickers trading as normal.

Traders who didn‚Äôt hop on a discounted Berkshire Hathaway stock but did buy heavily discounted shares in other brands will also be subject to having their trades struck off‚Äîwith the ruling not eligible for appeal.

Other tickers that were impacted include American restaurant chain Chipotle (CMG), mining company Barrack Gold Corporation (GOLD) and meme stock darling"" \*redacted\*.

However, as mentioned in the previous post, on average the rebalancing (selling 100% of the previous highest market cap stock and then buying with 100% of my portfolio the new highest market cap stock) occurred every 2.9 years. 

But what if we were to extend the back test to more than just 30 years? Here‚Äôs part 2 of this strategy: 1981-1994. This is how far back I could go, I couldn‚Äôt find yearly returns of stocks listed in the previous years. 

Again, this strategy will ONLY be applied to USA companies as so will the strategy. 

Results: from 1981 to half of 1988 the highest market cap was IBM. The returns during those years would have been: -16.19% in 1981; +69.22% in 1982; +26.75% in 1983; +0.92% in 1984; +26.30% in 1985; -22.83% in 1986; -2.89% in 1987 and +4.5% in half of 1988. 

Then XOM became the biggest market cap halfway through the year of 1988 and kept its dominance until the end of 1991. The returns would have been the following: +10% in half of 1988; +19.63% in 1989; +8.85% in 1990 and +23.30% in 1991. 

At the very start of 1992, GE became the highest market cap stock and it held its dominance throughout 1994. The returns would have been: +15.10% in 1992; +26.04% in 1993 and +0.21% in 1994. 

That leads us to an average pre tax return rate of 26.9%. With taxes, applied on the average of rebalancement during these years, which was 1 rebalancement every 2.14 years (in the calculations I considered every 2 years) we get an average after tax annual return rate of 21.27%. 


But how was the market doing during these times? From 1988 to 1994 the s&p 500 averaged an annual return rate of 13.5%.  The total backtest (part 1 and part 2) proves this strategy would have on average returned twice as much as the s&p 500 over the course of the last 37 years. 


PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT IM NOT CURRENTLY USING THIS STRATEGY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU IF NOT PROPERLY STUDIED BY EXPERTS.

PLEASE DONT JUST RANDOMLY START USING THIS STRATEGY ",1725103797.0,1319,621,2024-08-31 11:29:57

People in this sub need to understand that you only invest with the money you can afford to lose. Getting loans for buying stocks or putting your life's savings into this is not a great choice.,"New members of this sub need to understand to only put in money that they can afford to lose. I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon üöÄ""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

HIMS company stock drops after CEO applauds & offers employment to protesters,"After Andrew Dudum, CEO of the hair loss treatment company Hims & Hers tweeted on May 1st applauding the ‚Äúmoral courage‚Äù of the Pro-Palestine protesters, his company‚Äôs stock dropped drastically.

Don't be a regard and buy stocks from eavesdroping on wife's business calls,"
Tyler Loudon, a 42-year-old Houston man, learned this lesson the hard way. He pleaded guilty Thursday to securities fraud for buying and selling stocks based on details gleaned from his wife‚Äôs business conversations while both were working from home. He made $1.7 million in profits from the deal, but has agreed to forfeit those gains.

If you're gonna do it at least post the gain porn for us to see before you go to prison

Edit: I looked more into how he was caught and found this:

According to the SEC, Loudon stunned his wife by admitting he bought the shares to make enough money so she could work shorter hours.

She then notified BP and she was put on leave and then fired even though she had no knowledge he was going to do it.

She then filed for divorce.

Although I think she would wonder when they do their taxes why they owe $500k+ in taxes

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist.

GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.," 

>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!

Wrong.

No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

>WHAT?!

You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.

They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.

All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.

I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:

**# of Shares - Price**

x 20 - $0.30c

x 80 - $5

x 400 - $20

x 600 - $40

x 900 - $60

x 2,000 - $100

x 5,000 - $150

x 10,000 - $200

x 30,000 - $300

x 50,000 - $400

x 150,000 - $500

x 1 mil - $1,000

x 15 mil - $5,000

x 30 mil - $69,420

Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.

Get it?

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.

This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.",1612322227.0,28093,2124,2021-02-03 03:17:07

"Remember, the stock market didn't care about Bear Stearns failing...until it did","> The Bear Stearns hedge fund failures in mid-2007 were the first sign of a crash coming, but the market didn‚Äôt register concern. Stocks rose into October, when a 5-year bull market ended as the S&P 500 stock index topped out at 1,562. In January 2008, the S&P 500 entered a correction, down 10% from the peak. But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&P regained a few points.

> That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&P was down 20% from the prior peak‚Äîa bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman‚Äôs bankruptcy, leaving the S&P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier. The index would ultimately lose 57% of its value by the time it bottomed out in March 2009.

"I analyzed 2,000+ stock splits over the last 3 decades to see if you can make money from stock splits. Here are the results!","Stock splits are all the rage - After Google announced in Feb that there would be a 20:1 stock split in July this year, Amazon has followed suit announcing a similar 20:1 split and sending the market into a frenzy. Amazon‚Äôs price was up by 6% the next day and Google‚Äôs stock rose more than 9% in after-market trading following the news. Tesla is also planning for a second stock split and most recently, GME has also announced its stock split.

We do know that stock splits do not affect the underlying business in any way, but it is undeniable that there is price movement around the announcement and execution of a stock split. So in this week‚Äôs analysis, let‚Äôs deep-dive into the world of stock splits, how and why they are executed, and most important‚Ä¶ Is it possible to make money off of a stock split?

**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**

A stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let‚Äôs say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.

If you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.

* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start investing in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors \[1\] Also there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.
* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.
* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.

Now before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would start trading at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.

**Data**

For this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity‚Äôs stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.

This gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \[2\].¬†

**Returns**

As soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.

**Short Term Returns**

The short term plays possible around stock splits are:

1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.
2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.

https://preview.redd.it/j7ujpf1y2is81.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=60912ef1adabca10f9f857da0321abf1363f705a

As expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).

**Long Term Returns**

Considering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:

1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split
2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.

https://preview.redd.it/51513s603is81.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ed4a28a5e57254549e79a65ccd952219eea34a

Buying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.

But, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.

**What about H\*DLers?**

This is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \[3\]. Though most people wouldn‚Äôt trade by this strategy, it‚Äôs interesting to see how it would have fared. \[4\]

https://preview.redd.it/n6i7py113is81.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74d9f2afdcb64f342300dd6c6bb0169f208a58c

If you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&P 500 by close to 200%!

**How certain are our returns?**

Next, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.

https://preview.redd.it/w4506by13is81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd95395be1c8e00bb00ea578eea899d756fe635

Well, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.

**The cheap and the expensive**

The usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!

So obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?

The 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.

https://preview.redd.it/hzenccz23is81.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=4debdb20bdedbd1c9b06aa887de2acb8c5ee5569

The lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\[5\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.

One of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn‚Äôt invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn‚Äôt do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.

**Limitations**

The analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:

1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.
2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion.

**Conclusion**

Buying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.

And if you‚Äôre wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.

And finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it‚Äôs definitely worth looking into!

**Data:** All the raw data for the stock splits and returns for additional time periods that I could not showcase in this article [**can be found here.**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/stock-splits-data-6LUbbrOfFLo2cjV25RoXaQ/live)

**Footnotes**

\[1\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don‚Äôt want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.

Hasn't the risk subsided if the squeeze is done and the price will only fall?  What risk do they have if the short interest is actually down?

$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock,"Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone‚Äôs portfolio**. With Part 2, I‚Äôm addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  

-


**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**
-
Corsair didn‚Äôt snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:

-

*‚ÄúCorsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* 

*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**

-
With Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**

**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**
-

I cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:

* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. 
* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.
* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. 
* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.
* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.


-
Do yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There‚Äôs a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.

-
**Why hasn‚Äôt it blown up yet to +100?**
-

There is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. 

-
**Eagle What?**
-

This one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. 

They currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. 

This point doesn‚Äôt concern me too much personally, as it‚Äôs normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. 

-
**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**
-

They have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let‚Äôs go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let‚Äôs do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.

-

Instead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. 

-

**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I‚Äôll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**

-
I said it once, and I‚Äôll say it again. If you don‚Äôt hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that‚Äôs half the sub already, just do your wife‚Äôs boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**

-

**TL:DR**

Corsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad‚Äôs portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls.

"You're losing money because you're gambling, not because stock market is being manipulated","Over the last year or two, 90% of WSB has become people complaining that Elon Musk / Vlad / JPow / Trump / lizard people are robbing retail investors of their well deserved tendies.

Let me tell you one thing: when you gamble, you will most likely lose money. And that's not because some billionaire or politician ripped you off. Yes, they manipulate the market, but that's not why your penny stock tanked. You lose money because you're retarded enough to buy options instead of investing in blue chips on long term.

This is not a full DD. This is a post saying do not ****ing buy Krispy Kreme stock - this is a sunken ship.,"It was taken private in 2016 at a valuation of 1.35Bil. Tomorrow at IPO they are pricing shares at $17 for a valuation of 2.72 billion. Really? It's doubled in a 5 year period? No. It hasn't, this is JAB holdings realizing they bought something they probably shouldn't have, milked it for all it's worth and trying to scrap it for more then it paid for.

What are some RED FLAGS you might ask? Take a look at the S-1...

Of the last three fiscal years, it's only lost money in the last three. Said otherwise, 100% of the time of the required amount they need to show they have lost money. FY19-FY20 Organic revenue growth of 1.2%.. That won't even beat inflation. On the bright side- bottom-line was negative. They went from only losing 37 million in 2019 to losing 64 million in 2020. I didn't look to much more in-depth at the S-1 to see the valuation even though below the $21-24 they initially were trying to get.

It also has a billion in debt it didn't have when it went private.. curious...

Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year‚Äôs end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they‚Äôve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don‚Äôt settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia‚Äôs stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn‚Äôt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn‚Äôt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia‚Äôs place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn‚Äôt happened and Nvidia‚Äôs only gotten stronger.

That‚Äôs not to say over time Nvidia won‚Äôt lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it‚Äôs not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don‚Äôt think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia‚Äôs growth story.",1719798810.0,1047,514,2024-07-01 01:53:30

"About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.","https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html

SEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver
(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.

More than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.

The SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer‚Äôs shares.

GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.

While the SEC‚Äôs list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it‚Äôs evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.

Short sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren‚Äôt known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.

‚ÄúFails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,‚Äù reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. ‚ÄúTherefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‚Äònaked‚Äô short selling.‚Äù

Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there‚Äôs also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.

One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn‚Äôt be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop‚Äôs shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.

The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a ‚Äúcumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,‚Äù according to the SEC‚Äôs website.

About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.",1613576656.0,19040,669,2021-02-17 15:44:16

GME - Stock Dividend,"TL;DR short sellers and naked shorts still owe dividends. For short sellers they pay the lender. For naked shorts, they pay the dividend to the buyer. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense to hold the short position if the split is 7:1 or higher. So they‚Äôll have to cover and it could cause a squeeze that could cause a gamma squeeze.

Stock dividend isn‚Äôt a normal stock split. It has the same effect of a stock split but the mechanism is different.

Stock split: if there is 100 shares worth $10 each, a stock split, say 2:1 will make 200 shares each worth $5. In this case Hedgies etc don‚Äôt have to do anything. Life stays the same. Market cap is still $1000.

Stock Dividend: if there is 100 shares worth $10 and they want to do the same as 2:1 split effectively, the company doesn‚Äôt just proclaim a split, instead they give every stock holder a share. Effectively doubling the float as the same as the stock split. Market cap MAY stay high, increase or decrease https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp

The reason why this is a nuclear option on short sellers is that they have to buy an additional share to distribute to share holders they short sold shares to.

Why, that‚Äôs the brilliance behind a stock or cash dividend.  

If I buy a share and lend it out, and the person who borrowed it sold it, I‚Äôm still entitled to the dividend. The company will pay me the dividend. But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.

There‚Äôs 15M shorts (not including naked or phantom shares) Plus there‚Äôs the options chain, which is 10M shares at $200, 15M at $250, 20M at $300 (note my data only looks up to a year so it could be way more!!) So as shorts cover they‚Äôll run into a gamma squeeze.

The free float is 63M.
Insiders own 11M or 17%
Institutions own  16M or 26%
The near other half owned by individuals.

This is why a stock split it a nuclear option.

It forces short sellers to buy back shares before the ex dividend date probably sometime in June.

If they don‚Äôt they‚Äôre are on the hook for additional shares ie if the split is 2:1, they‚Äôll have to buy 15M shares, if 3:1 30M shares, and if 7:1 they‚Äôll buy 90M shares.

So I bet the split will be higher than the outstanding shares available of 75M. 6:1 will require 5 x 15M shares bought which is 75M. So 7:1 will cause a case where the shares that need to be bought will be higher than the float.

I‚Äôm not going to time when things will explode, short sellers are playing a dangerous game. Friday morning they dumped 1M shares at open:

Also the stock dividend is perfect vehicle to make the stock grow massively. Just look at Tesla:

So I‚Äôm just loading up now, don‚Äôt care about the price now for me because I know it‚Äôll at least double. If 7:1, it‚Äôll be historical.
